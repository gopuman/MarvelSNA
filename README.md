# MarvelSNA

Analyzing the social network formed by the interactions between marvel characters in comic books

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Networkx
- A software like Cytoscape/Gephi to visualize the graph

## Usage
- By default the graph.py script uses the hero-network.csv dataset. Similar datasets can be found:
  - [The Marvel Universe Social Network](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csanhueza/the-marvel-universe-social-network?resource=download)
  - [Star Wars Social Network](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/star-wars)
  - [Witcher Network](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/avasadasivan/witcher-network)
  
- Run the graph.py script
```
python3 graph.py
```

- The script outputs a file called `SG.gml` which can be used to visualize the graph

## Insights and Analysis
- My analysis of the graph can be found in the `MarvelSNA.pptx` file
